Inspired by Andrew Borstein's original website using Materialized. Very grateful that he allows others to adapt his design!

**TODO**
Widen the experience boxes (allow them to keep widening, increase max width)
Add media query to expand the projects grid to 4 per row
Color code the projects by type (web, ml, vision)
Create research tab with big boxes
